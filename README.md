# PDF RAG Knowledge Assistant

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built with **Python and LangChain** that allows an LLM to answer questions using information retrieved from PDF documents.

The project demonstrates the core RAG pipeline:

**PDF Documents → Text Extraction → Chunking → Embeddings → FAISS Vector Store → Similarity Search → LLM → Answer**

### Current Features

* Load text-based PDF documents using `PyPDFLoader`
* Extract text from PDF pages
* Split documents into smaller chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`
* Generate semantic embeddings using HuggingFace's `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
* Store document embeddings in a FAISS vector database
* Perform similarity search against the stored document chunks
* Provide retrieved context to an LLM
* Generate answers grounded in the retrieved document content
* Support multiple PDF documents

### Technologies

* Python
* LangChain
* HuggingFace Embeddings
* FAISS
* PyPDF
* LLMs

### Project Goal

The project is being developed incrementally to explore and implement practical RAG and agentic AI concepts, including document ingestion, retrieval, vector search, multi-document knowledge bases, conversation memory, and tool-based AI agents.

More features will be added progressively as the project evolves.
